# iOS-MVVM-C

**What is MVVM-C?**

MVVM-C is a design pattern that builds upon the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and adds a Coordinator layer to manage app navigation. In MVVM-C, the app’s navigation flow is handled by a dedicated Coordinator, responsible for instantiating and presenting view controllers, passing data between view controllers, and handling user actions.

The MVVM-C pattern is built around four core components:

- **Model**: The data model layer represents the app’s data, such as user profiles, product catalogs, or settings.
- **View**: The view layer displays the app’s user interface and communicates with the view model to update the UI based on the data model.
- **View Model**: The view model layer is an intermediary between the view and the data model. It retrieves data from the data model and transforms it into a format easily displayed by the view.
- **Coordinator**: The coordinator layer handles the app’s navigation flow. It is responsible for instantiating and presenting view controllers, passing data between view controllers, and handling user actions.

**Advantages of MVVM-C**

Using the MVVM-C pattern in iOS development offers several benefits:
- Separation of concerns: MVVM-C clearly separates concerns between the data model, view, view model, and coordinator layers, making it easier to test, debug, and maintain code.
- Scalability: MVVM-C is a scalable architecture that can easily accommodate changes and additions to the app’s functionality. The separation of concerns allows for independent development of each component, making it easier to update and modify code.
- Testability: The MVVM-C pattern allows for easy testing of each component in isolation, ensuring that each layer functions correctly before integrating them into the app.
- Reusability: The MVVM-C pattern allows for the reuse of code across the app, as each component can be used independently of the others.
